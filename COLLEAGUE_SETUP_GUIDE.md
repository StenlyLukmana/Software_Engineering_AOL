## Quick Start (Ready to Run!)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StenlyLukmana/Software_Engineering_AOL.git
   cd Software_Engineering_AOL
   ```

2. **Create environment file:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Or on Windows:
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Generate application key:**
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

4. **Install frontend dependencies and build assets:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

6. **Open your browser and visit:** `http://localhost:8000`

## âœ… That's it! The application is ready to use!

### What's Already Set Up:

- âœ… **All Composer dependencies** (vendor folder included)
- âœ… **SQLite database** with seeded data
- âœ… **Course data** pre-loaded
- âœ… **User accounts** ready for testing
- âœ… **Quiz functionality** fully configured
- âœ… **Authentication system** ready

### Test Accounts Available:

The database comes with pre-seeded test accounts. Check the database seeders or create new accounts through the registration system.

## Development Notes

- The project uses **SQLite** as the database (no additional database server needed)
- All dependencies are included in this repository for immediate setup
- The `.env` file will need to be configured for your local environment
- Frontend assets will need to be built with `npm run build` or `npm run dev`

## Troubleshooting

### If you encounter permission issues:
```bash
# Make sure storage and cache directories are writable
chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
```

### If you need to reset the database:
```bash
# The database is already set up, but if needed:
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

### For frontend development:
```bash
# Run in development mode with hot reload
npm run dev
```

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Make sure all prerequisites are installed
2. Check that PHP extensions are enabled (especially sqlite3, mbstring, xml)
3. Verify that the `.env` file is properly configured
4. Contact the team if problems persist

**Note:** This repository temporarily includes vendor dependencies and database files for easy setup. For ongoing development, these will be gitignored as normal.
